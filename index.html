        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Kylan Batts I am 16 years old and a junior in high school. I am not sure what college I want to go to but I know that I want to pursue design or maybe video game development. I am very passionate about design and specifically game design. I always try to be creative and express my ideas in unique ways in my work.  I usually spend most of my time playing video games, hanging out with friends or watching YouTube.</p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p> I usually spend most of my time playing video games, hanging out with friends or watching YouTube. I donâ€™t watch much TV anymore because its not as interesting as independent work and shows online. When I am designing an image or video editing I always try to put a spin on it and make the work my own. I enjoy making people laugh and always try to stay positive. In conclusion, I am a person who enjoys expressing ideas, being open-minded, and staying happy.</p>
